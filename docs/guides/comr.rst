.. _comr-relation:

Relation
========

This field is optional -- it will only be used when both related items are online


-   For recordings, the related items would be:

    -   The program book containing the recital program (in the `College
        of Music Program Book collection <https://digital.library.unt.ed/explore/CMPB/browse/>`_)
    -   Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) that degree-seeking
        performers have written as additional requirements for their
        program of study (these can be found in the `online ETD
        collection <https://digital.library.unt.ed/explore/UNTETD/browse/>`_)
        
-   Information will usually be added to the records for both items
-   For music programs (only), recordings will relate to the programs,
    but the program books will not relate back to the recording(s)
    because there would be too many references in one record

Exceptions and Miscellany
=========================

-   Always make the record "Hidden" if it is incomplete

Non-Recitals
------------

-   Some videos (and perhaps other items) may not align exactly with the
    guidelines in this documentation, e.g.: interviews or promotional
    videos
-   A couple of specific things to keep in mind:

    -   The record should always accurately describe the specific item
    -   Information should be as clear as possible for users
    -   Depending on the specific instance, some information may need to
        be omitted, added, or changed from the examples above in the
        interest of clarity and accuracy
