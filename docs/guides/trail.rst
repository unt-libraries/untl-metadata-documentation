Introduction
************

These guidelines supplement the current UNT Libraries' standards for creating metadata, focusing on 
items that belong to the `TRAIL Collection <https://digital.library.unt.edu/explore/collections/TRAIL/>`_.
For items that do not belong in this collection, please see the full :doc:`UNT Libraries Metadata Input Guidelines </input-guidelines-descriptive>`_.

TRAIL Metadata Input Guidelines
*******************************
Editors can access records by logging in at `https://edit.digital.library.unt.edu/ <https://edit.digital.library.unt.edu/>`_



Due to the way that template records are created when items are uploaded, there may be placeholders and/or duplicated values:

-   Unless specifically noted, duplicate entries should be deleted
-   Placeholders should be replaced with appropriate values or deleted/removed
-   When removing entries, use the "x" button in the lower-right corner


Information for TRAIL documents may be found on:

-   the cover page
-   the title page
-   introductory material (abstract, table of contents, etc.)
-   OCLC or catalog records
-   microform headers (for microfiche or microcards)


If there is a situation not covered on this page, use the links at the bottom of the individual field guidelines (or the "Help" links in the edit system) to find additional information

Title
=====

General Information
-------------------

-   All items must have one "Main Title" and at least one series title; some times may have additional titles
-   Always choose the appropriate qualifier (main, series, added, etc.) from the `controlled vocabulary <http://digital2.library.unt.edu/vocabularies/title-qualifiers/>`_


Main Titles
-----------

-   The main title should generally match the title on the title page of the report
-   Change ROman numerals to Arabic numbers and quote the original numerals in a :ref:`display note <trail-note>`
-   As necessary, add minor punctuation (commas or colons) or clarifications in [square brackets]

**Examples**
-   Absorption-Multistage Flash Distillation Process
-   Safety Rules for the Installation and Maintenance of Electrical Supply and Communication Lines
-   30 Megawatt Heat Exchanger and Steam Generator for Sodium Cooled Reactor System: Volume 4,
    Operation and Maintenance Procedures (*Display Note:* “Volume IV.”)
-   Aerial Radiological Monitoring System: \[Part\] 1. Theoretical Analysis, Design, and Operation
    of a Revised System


Series Titles
-------------

-   Every report should have at least one series title, generally representing the responsible
    agency
-   Some reports may also have `LC titles <https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html>` related to
    the report series, or be part of other series
-   Series titles should generally be written to be "human readable" unless they are authorized LC
    titles
-   List of `current series/serial titles
    <https://digital.library.unt.edu/explore/collections/TRAIL/titles/>`_

**Examples**
-   Argonne National Laboratory Reports
-   National Bureau of Standards Reports
-   Babcock & Wilcox Company Reports
-   United States Bureau of Mines Law Serials
-   LA (Series) (Los Alamos, N.M.)
-   AEC research and development report
-   Contributions to economic geology


Serial Titles
-------------

-   Most serials in this collection are regularly-issued reports (e.g., annual, quarterly, or
    monthly reports)
-   The serial title is the part that stays the same
-   We sometimes add clarifying information to make these titles more useful (e.g., "Argonne
    National Laboratory Annual Report" vs. "Annual Report", which could apply to any report)
-   More information on :doc:`Series and Serials </guides/serials>`
-   List of `current series/serial titles`_

**Examples**
-   Quarry Accidents in the United States During the Calendar Year
-   ANL Reactor Chemistry Division Annual Progress Report


Added Titles
------------
-   Every report should have an added title that includes the report number appended to the
    appropriate organization series title
-   Some items could have other added titles (e.g., variations in titles printed on cover vs. title
    page)


**Examples**
-   Argonne National Laboratory Report ANL-6437
-   United States Bureau of Mines Bulletin 5258
-   National Bureau of Standards Monograph 10


Alternate Titles
----------------
-   An alternate title can be included any time there are abbreviations/acronyms in the title to
    ensure that a written-out or full version is included as a searchable title



**Examples**
-   Report 1

    -   *Main Title:* Estimate of Known Recoverable Reserves and Preparation and Carbonizing
        Properties of Coking Coal in Campbell County, Tennessee
    -   *Alternate Title:* Estimate of Known Recoverable Reserves and Preparation and Carbonizing
        Properties of Coking Coal in Campbell County, Tenn.

-   Report 2

    -   *Main Title:* Hydrogeochemical and Stream Sediment Reconnaissance Basic Data for Rice Lake
        NTMS Quadrangle, Wisconsin
    -   *Alternate Title:* Hydrogeochemical and Stream Sediment Reconnaissance Basic Data for Rice
        Lake National Topographic Map Series Quadrangle, Wisconsin
