TRAIL Metadata Input Guidelines
*******************************
Editors can access records by logging in at `https://edit.digital.library.unt.edu/ <https://edit.digital.library.unt.edu/>`_



Due to the way that template records are created when items are uploaded, there may be placeholders and/or duplicated values:

-   Unless specifically noted, duplicate entries should be deleted
-   Placeholders should be replaced with appropriate values or deleted/removed
-   When removing entries, use the "x" button in the lower-right corner


Information for TRAIL documents may be found on:

-   the cover page
-   the title page
-   introductory material (abstract, table of contents, etc.)
-   OCLC or catalog records
-   microform headers (for microfiche or microcards)


If there is a situation not covered on this page, use the links at the bottom of the individual field guidelines (or the "Help" links in the edit system) to find additional information

.. _trail-title:

Title
=====

General Information
-------------------

-   All items must have one "Main Title" and at least one series title; some times may have additional titles
-   Always choose the appropriate qualifier (main, series, added, etc.) from the `controlled vocabulary <http://digital2.library.unt.edu/vocabularies/title-qualifiers/>`_


Main Titles
-----------

-   The main title should generally match the title on the title page of the report
-   Change Roman numerals to Arabic numbers and quote the original numerals in a :ref:`display note <trail-note>`
-   As necessary, add minor punctuation (commas or colons) or clarifications in [square brackets]

**Examples**
-   Absorption-Multistage Flash Distillation Process
-   Safety Rules for the Installation and Maintenance of Electrical Supply and Communication Lines
-   30 Megawatt Heat Exchanger and Steam Generator for Sodium Cooled Reactor System: Volume 4, Operation and Maintenance Procedures (*Display Note:* “Volume IV.”)
-   Aerial Radiological Monitoring System: [Part] 1. Theoretical Analysis, Design, and Operation of a Revised System


Series Titles
-------------

-   Every report should have at least one series title, generally representing the responsible
    agency
-   Some reports may also have `LC titles <https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html>` related to
    the report series, or be part of other series
-   Series titles should generally be written to be "human readable" unless they are authorized LC
    titles
-   List of `current series/serial titles
    <https://digital.library.unt.edu/explore/collections/TRAIL/titles/>`_

**Examples**
-   Argonne National Laboratory Reports
-   National Bureau of Standards Reports
-   Babcock & Wilcox Company Reports
-   United States Bureau of Mines Law Serials
-   LA (Series) (Los Alamos, N.M.)
-   AEC research and development report
-   Contributions to economic geology


Serial Titles
-------------

-   Most serials in this collection are regularly-issued reports (e.g., annual, quarterly, or
    monthly reports)
-   The serial title is the part that stays the same
-   We sometimes add clarifying information to make these titles more useful (e.g., "Argonne
    National Laboratory Annual Report" vs. "Annual Report", which could apply to any report)
-   More information on :doc:`Series and Serials </guides/serials>`
-   List of `current series/serial titles`_

**Examples**
-   Quarry Accidents in the United States During the Calendar Year
-   ANL Reactor Chemistry Division Annual Progress Report


Added Titles
------------
-   Every report should have an added title that includes the report number appended to the
    appropriate organization series title
-   Some items could have other added titles (e.g., variations in titles printed on cover vs. title
    page)


**Examples**
-   Argonne National Laboratory Report ANL-6437
-   United States Bureau of Mines Bulletin 5258
-   National Bureau of Standards Monograph 10


Alternate Titles
----------------
-   An alternate title can be included any time there are abbreviations/acronyms in the title to
    ensure that a written-out or full version is included as a searchable title



**Examples**
-   Report 1

    -   *Main Title:* Estimate of Known Recoverable Reserves and Preparation and Carbonizing
        Properties of Coking Coal in Campbell County, Tennessee

.. _trail-content-description:

Description: Content Description
================================

-   Describe what the item is *about* in full sentences, using proper grammar and punctuation (usually 1-3 sentences).
-   Cite quoted text (if applicable).
-   You may be able to use the abstract, but make sure that it actually describes the *content* of the report and label it as an abstract.  Extremely long abstracts should be summarized.
-   For multi-part/volume reports, the description should be about the content of the *specific* part or volume (so that users know which one is relevant).


**Examples**

-   Report discussing the relative thermal conductivities of liquid lithium, 
    sodium, and eutectic NaK, and the specific heat of liquid lithium, as well 
    as the methods and materials used to determine this information.
    
    
-   Report discussing a particular method of converting saline water through 
    vapor compression distillation at plants of different sizes. From Introduction: 
    "This report is divided into three Sections (Books) each with its own index. 
    Books I and II contain process and economic data for a 50,000 gpd pilot plant 
    and a 10,000,000 gpd production plant. Book III contains process and economic 
    data for high and low temperature units of 1,000,000 gpd size."
    
    
-   Quarterly report discussing progress on the Fast Ceramic Reactor Development 
    Program, "an integrated analytical and experimental program directed toward 
    the development of fast reactors employing ceramic fuels, with particular 
    attention to mixed plutonium-uranium oxide" (p. 1).
    
    
-   Abstract: A re-evaluation of the cost of producing essentially hafnium free 
    zirconium as zirconium oxide at a rate of 150,000-200,000 pounds zirconium 
    per year by solvent extraction of the metal thiocyanates in a permanent plant 
    has been made. Using part of the present temporary facilities, the cost, with 
    five year amortization of the plant, will be $3.15 per pound zirconium. 
    A by-product of the mixed oxides of hafnium and zirconium, having at least 
    fifty percent hafnium and perhaps as high as ninety percent hafnium, can be 
    made available with little additional cost.
    
    
-   First volume of the results of a detail area gamma ray and magnetic field 
    survey providing a general overview including: "1. Flight Operations; 2. Data 
    Acquisition and Processing; 3. Synopsis of Surface Geology; 4. Geologic Data 
    Interpretation; 5. Geochemical Data Interpretation; 6. Geologic-Geochemical 
    Analogy; 7. Summary and Recommendation for Geologic and Geochemical Units; 8.

    -   Subjects/keywords answer questions like: who, what, where, and
        when (without duplicating information in other fields)
        
-   Choose as many terms as necessary to capture subject content:

    -   Avoid terms too general to describe a particular item
    -   An average of five subject/keyword entries is recommended
    
-   Choose the correct subject type from the drop-down menu for each one

-   If relevant controlled terms are available, they must follow the formatting/punctuation rules of the controlled vocabulary
    -  E.g., Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms (LCGFT) are searchable in the edit form

-   Informal keywords may be added as needed to help users locate the resource
    -   Use plural forms of keywords
    -   The singular form of a keyword may be used when there is no reasonable plural
    -   If the keyword's plural is formed irregularly, the singular and plural forms can be added separately
    -   Break phrases into the smallest useful phrase
    -   Only capitalize proper nouns or acronyms


**Examples**

-   *Keyword:* Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor

        New Mexico" or "the area near Los Angeles, California"), include the location
    -   **Place Box:** Used to mark an area when a study is confined by specific coordinates (e.g., a quadrangle)
    -   **Coverage Date:** If the report *content* references a specific period (e.g., a 
        quarterly report or a survey/collection period) add a single coverage date for the time or range -- 
        this is *not* the publication date
