Guided Instructions: Create Records for Miscellaneous Text
==========================================================

This page is applicable to text materials that are not formally published, which may include:

-   informal pamhlets (e.g., event programs or flyers)
-   text of speeches, drafts or manuscripts
-	financial documents, such as receipts, invoices, bills, checks, balance sheets, etc.
-   legal documents (e.g., affadavits, warrants, deeds, etc.)
-   personal or organizational notes
-   semi-formal notes or recors (e.g., a ledger or notebook published as a pre-printed 
    blank book with handwritten or typewritten entries)
-   most handwritten notes


For some text items, it *may* be appropriate to refer to other guidelines:

-   If the item is a handwritten letter (or similar), consult the guidelines for :doc: `correspondence </guides/correspondence>`
-   When you have several items that are regularly-occurring documentation (e.g., meeting minutes, financial or statistical reports, etc.), 
    the guidelines for :doc: `serials </guides/serials>` will keep records consistent and reduce work
-   For the text of an interview, see :doc: `oral histories </guides/interviews>`


**How to use these instructions:**

-   This page walks step-by-step through creating a record for an item with yes/no questions 
    to guide how an editor should enter information for each field.
-   Although it includes quite a bit of detail, there may be specific situations that are not covered 
    (e.g., formatting for unusual names, less common issues, etc.), so there are links to the full guidelines 
    for each field to see more extensive explanations and example values.
-   Information should generally based off what you can see on the item that you're describing, but for some collections there
    may be other sources of information (e.g., a spreadsheet, finding aid, notes attached to items by donors
    or researchers, etc.), and should be incorporated appropriately.
    
    -   For example, if a question says "do you know when the text was written" the answer could be "yes" 
        if you have it from a known source, even if the date isn't written on the item.
    -   By default, only include information that you have available (vs. doing research, adding contextual 
        notes, or making assumptions).

-   Example values link to public records but not everything in the full metadata will necessarily apply.
-   In some cases, it may also help to look for similar items or collections that are already publicly visible.
-   *Note:* If you are not familiar with the UNTL metadata editing system or have not used it recently, it may
    also help to review some of the other general information such as the page about :doc:`navigating the system </technical/navigation>`
    or :doc:`completing metadata </technical/completing-records>`.

Description

Content Description
===================
-   The content description is required; it is based on looking at the item and describing the content of the text
-   Generally the description should not repeat information from other parts of the record (e.g., creator, creation date)
    and should provide more detail than the title
-   The description should focus on what is in the text rather than context or assumptions about what might be happening
-   There will generally be a placeholder entry labeled "content description" in the record

**Step 1.** Start with "Photograph of"

-   We do this to help orient users when they view a list of search results and to provide more context when metadata
    is harvested to other locations (like DPLA)
-   When applicable, this could be modified slightly, e.g., "Portrait of" / "Aerial photograph of" / etc.


**Step 2.** Describe anything of significance in the image, usually around 1-3 sentences, for example:

-   Are there people or animals in the image?

    -   Do you know names and/or identities (e.g., pictured from left to right)?
    -   What are the people or animals doing in the image?
    -   If it is a portrait (usually taken in a studio), how is the person posing and are they fully visible?

-   Are there buildings in the image?

    -   What kind of building is it (school building, store, house, etc.)?
    -   Is the name or address of the building known?
    -   Are there distinguishing features?

-   Was the photo taken inside or outside?  At a particular angle, looking up or down?

-   Is there anything taking up a large amount of space (e.g., left/right side of the image, foreground/background, etc.)?

    -   It is generally helpful to mainly describe anything that is the focus of the image, but most of the time there should also
        be at least a brief mention of anything else (e.g., something partially visible on one side of the photo, something
        in the background, etc.)
    -   What else is visible around the people, buildings, etc.?


**Step 3.** When relevant, it may also be helpful to include additional information on the item, such as a handwritten
note on the back

-   This information may also be appropriate in a display note, especially if the description is already long
-   It is not necessary to incorporate information in the description and repeat it as quoted text


.. note::

    Remember that *contextual* information generally belongs in a note, unless it is very brief, for example:
    
    -   additional information about how/when a photo was taken
    -   biographical information about a person in a photo
    -   details about locations in the image (e.g., when a house was built and its ownership history)
    -   other related historical information (e.g., about an event happening in the image)

*   :ref:`More content description guidelines <description-cfill>`


Physical Description
====================
-   The physical description is not required, but is encouraged and is easy to include at least in part
-   There will generally be a placeholder entry labeled "physical description" in the record
-   Details in the placeholder should be checked for the individual photograph and changed (if different) or removed if they cannot be verified (e.g., if dimensions
    are unknown)
    
    -   Format is generally known from looking at the physical item, or from information documented about the image
    -   Photos that have a single front and back are prints; negatives on glass or film, and born-digital images will only have a single image
    -   Do not include format details if you do not have information available


**Step 1.**  List the number of photograph(s)

-   This is almost always 1 photograph
-   *Occasionally* there might be more than one photo, e.g., multiple photos printed on or affixed to a page, two daguerreotypes in a case, etc.


**Step 2.**  Add any known details about format and color after " : "

-   Is this image any format other than a photo printed on paper?  E.g.:

    -   negative (on film), positive (slide), glass photonegative (negative on glass)
    -   digital
    -   daguerreotype (printed on silver-plated copper), tintype (printed on metal)
    -   ambrotype (negative on glass in a dark case)

-   Is the image color (col.) or black-and-white (b&w)?


**Step 3.**  If known, add dimensions after " ; " in h x w using appropriate units

-   Is the image a "standard size"?  (See the :ref:`full list <description-comments>`.)

    -   for prints: 8 x 10 in. / 5 x 7 in. / 4 x 6 in.
    -   for negatives: 35 mm. (also applies to slides) / 4 x 5 in. / 6 x 6 cm. / 6 x 9 cm.
    -   cabinet cards: 17 x 12 cm. (this is 4.5 x 6.5 in.)
    -   cartes de visite: 11 x 7 cm. (this is 4 x 2.5 in.)
    -   if it is NOT a standard size, measure total dimensions rounding up to the next whole cm.
    -   for born-digital images: h x w px. (pixels)

-   Is the image in something (like a frame or folder), or affixed to something (like a page or mat)?  If yes:

    -   add a comma after initial dimensions and add additional details, such as:
    
        -   on sheet h x w cm.
        -   in frame h x w cm.
        -   in folder h x w cm., folded to h x w cm.
        -   on mat h x w cm.
        -   in case h x w cm., folded to h x w cm.

*******
Subject
*******

-   At least two (2) subjects of any type are required for every metadata record
-   There may be suggested placeholder terms in the record; any terms that are not useful to find that *specific* photo should be changed or removed
-   The use of controlled vocabularies is not required (except UNTL-BS for photos in the Portal and Gateway), but *when available* they may be
    helpful in some circumstances outlined below

Keywords & Names
================

-   Keywords can be used for any term that would be helpful to someone searching for *this particular* photo
-   They should be lowercase and plural (unless they are proper names)
-   Do not duplicate information from other fields (e.g., creator, coverage place, resource type) or from other subject terms

*   :ref:`More keyword guidelines <subject-kwdformat>`



-   If a person or animal is *physically visible* in an image and you know their name, add a named person or named animal entry
-   When a person is related to the content (e.g., John Smith's house) but not visible, the name can be a keyword
-   Invert personal names (last, first); nicknames may be included in subjects (but not in creator/contributor)

    -   Note that a named person can be only a surname if a full name is unknown (e.g., portrait of the Baxter family) but
        *must* include a surname (e.g., not "Aunt Lydia")

-   For certain collections, other kinds of controlled subjects may be used (Chenhall's Nomenclature, Homosaurus, Medical Subject Headings, etc.)
-   Note that you *should not* include terms that are inappropriate for the collections
    or material type, even though they may be available, for example:

    -   Library of Congress Medium of Performance Thesaurus: applies to recordings or musical literature (for images of instruments use keywords, AAT, etc.)
    -   Legislative Indexing Vocabulary/Legislative Subject Terms: applies to government documents and is used in specific collections

******************
Lesser-Used Fields
******************
The rest of the available fields are either rarely used for photographs, or usually pre-populated during upload and 
rarely *changed.*  Use the links to get additional information and resources when needed.  Here is a brief explanation 
of how the fields are used (and why you likely won't edit them), along with a series of questions to help you determine 
if an exception might apply for a specific item:

-   :doc:`primary source </fields/primary-source>` - photographs are generally considered primary sources (and this is usually pre-marked)
-   :doc:`source </fields/source>` - source generally reflects a parent item if we separate a part (e.g., a map from a report)
-   :doc:`citation </fields/citation>` - this is mainly used to parse citation components for items published as serials (like journal articles)
-   :doc:`relation </fields/relation>` - relationships connect two or more items in the Digital Collections when they are related in specific ways
-   :doc:`collection </fields/collection>` and :doc:`institution </fields/institution>` - these fields are pre-set and should not be changed because
    they are used to provide editing access; you may lose permissions if you change these values
-   :doc:`rights </fields/rights>` - there is a general, systemwide rights statement in the public interface, so most rights information is only added
    when there is something explicitly noted for the item
-   :doc:`resource type </fields/resource-type>` - generally pre-set to "photograph"
-   :doc:`format </fields/format>` - generally pre-set to "image" (format matches resource type)
-   :doc:`identifier </fields/identifier>` - most photographs will be uploaded with the locally-assigned identifier already entered in the identifier 
    field (i.e., the identifier that the partner organization or owner uses to match the digital copy to the physical copy); photographs rarely have 
    additional identifiers
-   :doc:`degree </fields/degree>` - the degree field is only used for items created at UNT to document the originating college/department

*********************
Completing the Record
*********************
-   Double-check the right side of the screen:

    -   Are there any field counts in red?  (These are *required* fields that have missing values.)
    -   Are there any warning messages?  (Check any fields that need review, resolve any issues for dates, subjects, etc.)

-   Clicking the "Publish" button will save any changes you have made to the record
-   Most of the time you should mark the record "visible" if all information has been entered, to make the record public
-   If you need to come back to a record later, you can leave the record hidden and publish changes to save the current version
