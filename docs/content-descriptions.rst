More Guidance for Formulating Content Descriptions
==================================================
This page is intended to supplement general guidelines for 
:ref:`content descriptions <description-content>`; 
in some cases, there may also be collection- or material-specific guidelines 
that already have additional suggestions and examples, including:

-    :doc:`Correspondence </guides/correspondence>`
-    :doc:`Serials </guides/serials>`
-    :doc:`Oral histories </guides/interviews>`
-    :doc:`Photos </guides/photos>`

(See the full list of guides in the left-hand menu.)

*******
Purpose
*******
The best place to start thinking about how to write a content description is to 
consider what purpose it serves.  Mainly, it is intended to help a user determine
if an item will be useful for their purposes, or contains the information they
are seeking.  In library parlance, we talk about user tasks and how item records
assist a user to (1) find materials, (2) identify which items may be useful, (3)
select the most appropriate options, and (4) obtain those books/items.  Digital 
libraries collapse some of those steps by providing immediate access, but when
a user is researching or looking for something specific, it can still be difficult
to look at a list of hundreds of search results and identify the most likely options.


One thing to remember is that the purpose for an item may not be the same for every user.
For example, multiple people might find the same image of a house useful in different
ways such as:

-   an image of an architectural feature
-   context for genealogical research into owners
-   an example of a photographic format or technique
-   color ideas or images for an artwork
-   landscaping ideas
-   handwriting samples (if something is written on the back)


There is no expectation that we can guess every possible use-case or incorporate
all of them into a content description.  But the general idea is to describe the
overall content in a neutral way so that most users would be able to tell if the 
thing they need is likely to be in the text or image of that item.


Other general considerations when thinking about what to include:

-   Content descriptions display in search results and are part of the harvested
    information shared with DPLA, etc. (sometimes this is the primary text a user
    is looking at to determine usefulness)
-   For an image or handwritten materials, only the information in the record is
    searchable vs. printed text in which the full-text of the item is *also* searchable
-   A description should mention anything significant or out of the ordinary, but
    not every single detail; for *most* items, a description should not take
    more than 5 minutes or so
-   Generally try not to repeat information from other fields (creator, subject,
    coverage, etc.) unless it serves a specific purpose or is central to the content
-   Even though a description should start with the type of item, try to avoid
    short, choppy sentences


The next sections give more specific examples and suggestions based on material
types.

Text
****
In some ways, text can be easier than images, because it usually has a coherent
topic and published items likely have some kind of description already.  The 
challenge is summarizing in a way that is helpful for users.

Yearbooks, newsletters, journals, other serials
===============================================
-  Note that there are guidelines specifically for :doc:`Serials </guides/serials>` and the description for a 
   serial will generally be essentially the same across item records

Pamphlets, booklets, flyers, etc.
=================================

-  For some booklets or pamphlets, it may be appropriate to follow the guidance for book-like items; for our purposes 
   a "pamphlet" is 50 pages or less and a book is >50 pages, but the content may still be a report or description of a 
   specific topic (and may have multiple sections or a table of contents)
-  If the content is more similar to another type (e.g., newsletter, report, catalog, etc.), review the most appropriate section
   to describe that particular item

Clippings
=========

-  Clippings can generally refer to any piece that has been removed from a larger text, but can vary in scope, e.g., an
   article cut out of a newspaper and a whole newspaper page (not a full issue) would both be labeled as clippings

+---------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

Legal and legislative documents
===============================

-   Legal documents can be any formal, government-issued or attorney-drafted statements, proceedings, etc.
-   Legislative documents are issued by legislative bodies (e.g., text of bills) or legislative proceedings
    that do not fall under another category (e.g., reports by a legislative body or committee would be treated
    as "reports"; compilations of proceedings may be treated as "books")
