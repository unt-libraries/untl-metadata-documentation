More Guidance for Formulating Content Descriptions
==================================================
This page is intended to supplement general guidelines for content descriptions; 
in some cases, there may also be colleciton- or material-specific guidelines 
that already have additional suggestions and examples, including:

-    :doc:`Serials </guides/serials>`
-    :doc:`Oral histories </guides/interviews>`

*******
Purpose
*******
The best place to start thinking about how to write a content description is to 
think about what purpose it serves.  Mainly, it is intended to help a user determine
if an item will be useful for their purposes, or contains the information they
are seeking.  In library parlance, we talk about user tasks and how item records
assist a user to (1) find materials, (2) identify which items may be useful, (3)
select the most appropriate options, and (4) obtain those books/items.  Digital 
libraries collapse some of those steps by providing immediate access, but when
a user is researching or looking for something specific, it can still be difficult
to look at a list of hundreds of search results and identify the most likely options.


One thing to consider is that the purpose for an item may not be the same for every user.
For example, multiple people might find the same image of a house useful in different
ways such as:

-   an image of an architectural feature
-   context for genealogical research into owners
-   an example of a photographic format or technique
-   color ideas or images for an artwork
-   landscaping ideas
-   handwriting samples (if something is written on the back)


There is no expectation that we can guess every possible use-case or incorporate
all of them into a content description.  But the general idea is to describe the
overall content in a neutral way so that most users would be able to tell if the 
thing they need is likely to be in the text or image of that item.


Other general considerations when thinking about what to include:

-   Content descriptions display in search results and are part of the harvested
    information shared with DPLA, etc. (sometimes this is the primary text a user
    is looking at to determinue usefulness)
-   For an image or handwritten materials, only the information in the record is
    searchable vs. printed text in which the full-text of the item is *also* searchable
-   A description should mention anything significant or out of the ordinary, but
    not every single detail; for *most* items, a description should not take
    more than 5 minutes or so
-   Generally try not to repeat information from other fields (creator, subject,
    coverage, etc.) unless it serves a specific purpose or is central to the content


The next sections give more specific examples and suggestions based on material
types.

Text
****
In some ways, text can be easier than images, because it usually has a coherent
topic and published items likely have some kind of description already.  The 
challenge is summarizing in a way that is helpful for users.

Images
******
For items like photos, artworks, maps, or other images (like logos), you want to
describe what is actually visible in the image and any other component that may
not be expected for the item (e.g., text on the back of a photo has usually been
added after the fact and is only present on some items).


Some general questions:

-   Is there an overall theme/focus (a portrait or a landscape)?
-   Are there people, buildings, geographic features?
-   Do you know contextual information (e.g., image of an event)?
-   Are there any obvious or unusual components (e.g., text on a photo, graphic
    icons on a map, etc.)
