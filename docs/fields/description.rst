   :alt: Screenshot of description element in metadata editing system.

Parts:
   #. Description type -- drop-down menu
   #. Description -- text field

Repeatable?
    Yes - clicking 'Add' repeats all field parts; there should only be two description fields (one for content and one for physical description)

Required?
    Yes - a content description is required; a physical description is highly recommended.  Also see :doc:`more information </minimally-viable-records>` about required fields



*Note:* Given the significant differences for entering description information, guidance sections are repeated separately for 
:ref:`content descriptions <description-content>` and :ref:`physical descriptions <description-physical>` below.
