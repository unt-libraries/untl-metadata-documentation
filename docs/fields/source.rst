-   This field is only used if the item is:

    -   a derivation (a single map from a book, an article from a
        journal, etc.)
    -   an item that was part of a larger event (a presentation from a
        conference, a piece from an exhibition, etc.)

-   Formatting is not strictly enforced in this field, but it is helpful to list information consistently:

    -   include any known relevant information
    -   use a standard citation format, if applicable

-   Choose the appropriate relation qualifier from the `controlled vocabulary <https://digital2.library.unt.edu/vocabularies/sourceQualifiers/>`_
-   Note that published conference proceedings should be treated as a publication source (book or journal), 
    while non-published components (e.g., posters or presentations) should use the conference or event as the source
-   If none of the qualifiers applies to the item, choose "Other"
