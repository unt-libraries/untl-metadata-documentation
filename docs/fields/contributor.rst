****************************************
How Should the Contributor be Filled in?
****************************************

General Contributor Rules
=========================

-   If no contributor information is readily available, leave the field blank
-   Only include individuals/organizations who had secondary
    responsibility for the item, or who were only responsible for a portion of the work
    
    -   Primary "contributors" should be entered as :doc:`creators </fields/creator>` instead
        
        -   A name should never be entered as both a creator and a
            contributor; if an agent acts in multiple capacities, see
            the :ref:`Role <contributor-role>` section for clarification
        -   For more information about when a person/organization is a
            creator or a contributor, see our :doc:`definition page </creator-contributor-definitions>`
            
    -   An entity **must** have a direct relationship to the item that
        can be explicated in order to be included as a contributor
        
        -   If there is information about a person/organization that
            cannot be expressed as a role, it may be appropriate to add
            it elsewhere, such as a :doc:`Note </fields/note>` or :ref:`Info <contributor-info>` in relation to
            an established contributor
            
-   Include as many contributors as are readily available

    -   A contributor name can only be entered once per record; if an agent acts in multiple capacities, see
        the :ref:`Role <contributor-role>` section for clarification
    -   Place them in order of importance
    -   If contributors are equally important, list them in the order that they appear
    -   If a document has an excessively large number of creators or
        authors (e.g., several hundred researchers) include the parent
        organizations as creators and the individual persons as
        contributors
        
-   For each contributor the name, type, and role are **required**
-   If possible, consult an authority file to find the correct form of
    the name, such as:
    
    -   The `UNT Name App <https://digital2.library.unt.edu/name/>`_
    -   The `Library of Congress Authorities <https://id.loc.gov>`__
    -   A locally-developed utility
    
-   Note that organizational names generally reflect the name of the agency at
    the time the item was created -- e.g., Texas (Republic) vs. Texas, or North
    Texas State University vs. University of North Texas -- however, if possible,
    personal names will generally reflect a single, most current version when
    multiple names (initials, maiden names, etc.) are known to be used by a
    specific person

Assigning Roles
---------------

-   Although the same list of roles is available for both creators and
    contributors, some roles will generally only apply to contributors:
    
    -   Agents who only had responsibility for a part, e.g., author of
        introduction, etc.; witness; consultant; expert
    -   Agents who had an indirect relationship, e.g., funder, sponsor,
        former owner, donor
    -   Additional explanation is on our contributor and contributor :doc:`definition page </creator-contributor-definitions>`
    
-   The role should describe the action that the agent took in creating
    the item and it may not align with job titles or credentials, for
    example:

-   Name fields are connected to the `UNT Name App`_, which will try to
    match text against local authority files. Editors should always
    choose an authorized form from the list if it is available.
-   The contributor field is not constrained by the AACR2 practice of
    limiting contributors to three or fewer names. Include as many contributors
    as are readily available.
-   If the contributor and the publisher are the same, repeat the name in
    the :doc:`Publisher </fields/publisher>` element.
-   Individuals or organizations with greater or complete responsibility for creation
    of the intellectual content of the resource should be recorded in
    the :doc:`Creator </fields/creator>` element instead of the contributor
    element. Some examples of creators are author, editor, compiler, etc. (when applicable to the whole item)
-   The contributor roles come primarily from MARC `relator codes <http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relators.html>`_; not
    all of the Library of Congress roles are included in the UNT system
    and several local codes have been added to the UNT list.
