Comments
********

-   Collections are determined based on a large group of related items,
    intended to facilitate browsing, such as:
    
    -   Topical groupings
    -   Historic events
    -   Serial sets -- especially full runs of a publication during
        which the title changes
    -   Projects sponsored by a grant or special funding
    
-   In some cases, all items from one institution may also belong to a
    single collection, however, large, distinctive groups may have their
    own collection
-   Although some archival collections may have a corresponding
    "collection," small collections or archival series may also be
    represented as [series titles][]
