UNT Technical Guidelines
========================

The pages in this section document technical and administrative aspects of UNT metadata.


Identifier Management
=====================
UNT mints local identifiers for a number of uses, including all authority records.  For digital objects, 
UNT uses ARKs (archival resource keys) appended directly to the associated public or administrative URL in the format:
ark:/67531/{metaid}, where 67531 designates the organization (UNT) generating the ARK.

Every metaid is unique and assigned sequentially, under several domains:

+-----------+-------------------------------+
|Prefix     |Used for:                      |
+===========+===============================+
|metapth    |The Portal to Texas History    |
+-----------+-------------------------------+
|metadc     |UNT Digital Library &          |
|           |Gateway to Oklahoma History    |
+-----------+-------------------------------+
|coda       |BagIt information records      |

Authority Control
=================
UNT maintains a number of controlled vocabularies and authority files to
augment metadata creation, including:

    -   controlled vocabularies for qualifiers and selected field values
    -   local name authority files (for people, organizations, events, software, and buildings)
    -   serial/series title records
    -   location records
