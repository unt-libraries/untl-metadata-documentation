Create Records for Photographs
==============================

This page refers to records for photographs, which may include:

-   images captured on film as negatives or positives (slides, transparencies)
-   images printed from negatives on paper
-	image files captured by a digital camera
-   photographic images captured on metal (tintypes) 
-   photographic images captured on glass as negatives (glass plates) or positives (ambrotypes)
-   images printed on paper and affixed to a mat or paper (such as a scrapbook page) when the photograph(s) are the primary content


**How to use these instructions:**

-   This page walks step-by-step through creating a record for a photograph with yes/no questions 
    to guide how an editor should enter information for each field.
-   Although it includes quite a bit of detail, there may be specific situations that are not covered 
    (e.g., formatting for unusual names, less common issues, etc.), so there are links to the full guidelines 
    for each field to see more extensive explanations and example values.
-   Information should generally based off what you can see on the item that you're describing, but for some collections there
    may be other sources of information (e.g., a spreadsheet, finding aid, notes attached to items by donors
    or researchers, etc.), and should be incorporated appropriately.  For example, if a question says "do you
    know when the photograph was taken" the answer could be "yes" if you have it from a known source, even if
    the date isn't written on the item.
-   Example values link to public record but not everything in the full metadata will necessarily apply.
-   In some cases, it may also help to look for similar items or collections that are already publicly visible.
-   *Note:* If you are not familiar with the UNTL metadata editing system or have not used it recently, it may
    also help to review some of the other general information such as the page about :doc:`navigating the system </technical/navigation>`
    or :doc:`completing metadata </technical/completing-records>`.

|   -   A photo taken on one of several dates (e.g., summer or  |                                                           |

Description

Content Description
===================
-   The content description is required; it is based on looking at the photo and describing what is visible in the image
-   Generally the description should not repeat information from other parts of the record (e.g., creator, creation date)
    and should provide more detail than the title
-   There will generally be a placeholder entry labeled "content description" in the record

**Step 1.** Start with "Photograph of"

-   We do this to help orient users when they view a list of search results and to provide more context when metadata
    is harvested to other locations (like DPLA)
-   When applicable, this could be modified slightly, e.g., "Portrait of" / "Aerial photograph of" / etc.


**Step 2.** Describe anything of significance in the image, usually around 1-3 sentences, for example:

-   Are there people or animals in the image?

    -   Do you know names and/or identities (e.g., pictured from left to right)?
    -   What are the people doing in the image?
    -   If it is a portrait (usually taken in a studio), how is the person posing and are they fully visible?

-   Are there buildings in the image?

    -   What kind of building is it (school building, store, house, etc.)?
    -   Is the name or address of the building known?
    -   Are there distinguishing features?

-   Was the photo taken inside or outside?  At a particular angle, looking up or down?

-   Is there anything taking up a large amount of space (e.g., left/right side of the image, foreground/background, etc.)?

    -   It is generally helpful to focus on anything that is the focus of the image, but most of the time there should also
        be at least a brief mention of anything else (e.g., something partially visible on one side of the photo, something
        in the background, etc.)
    -   What else is visible around the people, buildings, etc.?


**Step 3.** When relevant, it may also be helpful to include additional information on the item, such as a handwritten
note on the back

-   This information may also be appropriate in a display note, especially if the description is already long
-   It is not necessary to incorporate information in the description and repeat it as quoted text


.. note::

    Remember that *contextual* information generally belongs in a note, unless it is very brief, for example:
    
    -   additional information about how/when a photo was taken
    -   biographical information about a person in a photo
    -   details about locations in the image (e.g., when a house was built and its ownership history)

Physical Description
===================
-   The physical description is not required, but is encouraged and is easy to include at least in part
-   There will generally be a placeholder entry labeled "physical description" in the record; details in the placeholder should
    be checked for the individual photograph and changed (if different) or removed if they cannot be verified (e.g., if dimensions
    are unknown)


**Step 1.**  List the number of photograph(s)

-   This is almost always 1 photograph
-   *Occasionally* there might be more than one photo, e.g., multiple photos printed on or affixed to a page, two daguerreotypes in a case, etc.


**Step 2.**  Add any details about format and color after " : "

-   Is this image any format other than a photo printed on paper?  E.g.:

    -   negative (on film), positive (slide), glass photonegative (negative on glass)
    -   digital
    -   daguerreotype (printed on silver-plated copper), tintype (printed on metal)
    -   ambrotype (negative on glass in a dark case)

-   Is the image color (col.) or black-and-white (b&w)?


**Step 3.**  If known, add dimensions after " ; " in h x w using appropriate units

-   Is the image a "standard size"?  (See the :ref:`full list <description-comments>`.)

    -   for prints: 8 x 10 in. / 5 x 7 in. / 4 x 6 in.
    -   for negatives: 35 mm. (also applies to slides) / 4 x 5 in. / 6 x 6 cm. / 6 x 9 cm.
    -   cabinet cards: 17 x 12 cm. (this is 4.5 x 6.5 in.)
    -   cartes de visite: 11 x 7 cm. (this is 4 x 2.5 in.)
    -   if it is NOT a standard size, measure total dimensions rounding up to the next whole cm.
    -   for born-digital images: h x w px. (pixels)

-   Is the image in something (like a frame or folder), or affixed to something (like a page or mat)?  If yes:

    -   add a comma after initial dimensions and add additional details, such as:
    
        -   on sheet h x w cm.
        -   in frame h x w cm.
        -   in folder h x w cm., folded to h x w cm.
        -   on mat h x w cm.
        -   in case h x w cm., folded to h x w cm.

*******
Subject
*******

-   At least two (2) subjects of any type are required for every metadata record
-   There may be suggested placeholder terms in the record; any terms that are not useful to find that *specific* photo should be changed or removed
-   The use of controlled vocabularies is not required (except UNTL-BS for photos in the Portal and Gateway), but *when available* they may be
    helpful in some circumstances outlined below

Keywords & Names
================

-   Keywords can be used for any term that would be helpful to someone searching for *this particular* photo
-   They should be lowercase and plural (unless they are proper names)
-   Do not duplicate information from other fields (e.g., creator, coverage place, resource type) or from other subject terms

******************
Lesser-Used Fields
******************
The rest of the available fields are either rarely used for photographs, or usually pre-populated during upload and 
rarely *changed.*  Use the links to get additional information and resources when needed.  Here is a brief explanation 
of how the fields are used (and why you likely won't edit them), along with a series of questions to help you determine 
if an exception might apply for a specific item:

-   :doc:`primary source </fields/primary-source>` - photographs are generally considered primary sources (and this is usually pre-marked)
-   :doc:`source </fields/source>` - source generally reflects a parent item if we separate a part (e.g., a map from a report)
-   :doc:`citation </fields/citation>` - this is used to parse citation components for items published as serials (like journal articles)
-   :doc:`relation </fields/relation>` - relationships connect two or more items in the Digital Collections when they are related in specific ways
-   :doc:`collection </fields/collection>` and :doc:`institution </fields/institution>` - these fields are pre-set and should not be changed because
    they are used to provide editing access; you may lose permissions if you change these values
-   :doc:`rights </fields/rights>` - there is a general rights statement applied systemwide, so most rights information is only added
    when there is something explicitly noted for the item
-   :doc:`resource type </fields/resource-type>` - generally pre-set to "photograph"
-   :doc:`format </fields/format>` - generally pre-set to "image" (format matches resource type)
-   :doc:`identifier </fields/identifier>` - most photographs will be uploaded with the locally-assigned identifier already entered in the identifier 
    field (i.e., the identifier that the partner organization or owner uses to match the digital copy to the physical copy); photographs rarely have 
    additional identifiers
-   :doc:`degree </fields/degree>` - the degree field is only used for items created at UNT to document the originating college/department
