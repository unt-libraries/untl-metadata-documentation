==============================
Create Records for Photographs
==============================

This page refers to records for photographs, which may include:

-   images captured on film as negatives or positives (slides, transparencies)
-   images printed from negatives on paper
-	image files captured by a digital camera
-   photographic images captured on metal (tintypes) 
-   photographic images captured on glass as negatives (glass plates) or positives (ambrotypes)
-   images printed on paper and affixed to a mat or paper (such as a scrabook page) when the photograph(s) are the primary content


**How to use these instructions:**

-   This page walks step-by-step through creating a record for a photograph with yes/no questions 
    to guide how an editor should enter information for each field.  
-   Although it includes quite a bit of detail, there may be specific situations that are not covered 
    (e.g., formatting for unusual names, less common issues, etc.), so there are links to the full guidelines 
    for each field to see more extensive explanations and example values.  
-   In some cases, it may also help to look for similar items or collections that are already publicly visible.

-   In the title field, choose "Main Title" in the drop-down menu (if it is not already marked)
