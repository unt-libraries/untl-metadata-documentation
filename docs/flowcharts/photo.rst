Create Records for Photographs
==============================

This page refers to records for photographs, which may include:

-   images captured on film as negatives or positives (slides, transparencies)
-   images printed from negatives on paper
-	image files captured by a digital camera
-   photographic images captured on metal (tintypes) 
-   photographic images captured on glass as negatives (glass plates) or positives (ambrotypes)
-   images printed on paper and affixed to a mat or paper (such as a scrapbook page) when the photograph(s) are the primary content


**How to use these instructions:**

-   This page walks step-by-step through creating a record for a photograph with yes/no questions 
    to guide how an editor should enter information for each field.
-   Although it includes quite a bit of detail, there may be specific situations that are not covered 
    (e.g., formatting for unusual names, less common issues, etc.), so there are links to the full guidelines 
    for each field to see more extensive explanations and example values.
-   Information should generally based off what you can see on the item that you're describing, but for some collections there
    may be other sources of information (e.g., a spreadsheet, finding aid, notes attached to items by donors
    or researchers, etc.), and should be incorporated appropriately.  For example, if a question says "do you
    know when the photograph was taken" the answer could be "yes" if you have it from a known source, even if
    the date isn't written on the item.
-   Example values link to public record but not everything in the full metadata will necessarily apply.
-   In some cases, it may also help to look for similar items or collections that are already publicly visible.
-   *Note:* If you are not familiar with the UNTL metadata editing system or have not used it recently, it may
    also help to review some of the other general information such as the page about :doc:`navigating the system </technical/navigation>`
    or :doc:`completing metadata </technical/completing-records>`.

Content Description
===================
-   The content description is required; it is based on looking at the photo and describing what is visible in the image
-   There will generally be a placeholder entry labeled "content description" in the record







+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                                                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+



Physical Description
===================
-   The physical description is not required, but is encouraged and is easy to include at least in part
-   There will generally be a placeholder entry labeled "physical description" in the record; details in the placeholder should
    be checked for the individual photograph and changed (if different) or removed if they cannot be verified (e.g., if dimensions
    are unknown)


**Step 1.**  List the number of photograph(s)

-   This ia almost always 1 photograph
-   *Occasionally* there might be more than one photo, e.g., multiple photos printed on or affixed to a page, two daguerreotypes in a case, etc.


**Step 2.**  Add any details about format and color after " : "

-   Is this image any format other than a photo printed on paper?  E.g.:

    -   negative (on film), positive (slide), glass photonegative (negative on glass)
    -   digital
    -   daguerreotype (printed on silver-plated copper), tintype (printed on metal)
    -   ambrotype (negative on glass in a dark case)

-   Is the image color (col.) or black-and-white (b&w)?


**Step 3.**  If known, add dimensions after " ; " in h x w using appropriate units

-   Is the image a "standard size"?  (See the full list.)

    -   for prints: 8 x 10 in. / 5 x 7 in. / 4 x 6 in.
    -   for negatives: 35 mm. (also applies to slides) / 4 x 5 in. / 6 x 6 cm. / 6 x 9 cm.
    -   cabinet cards: 17 x 12 cm. (this is 4.5 x 6.5 in.)
    -   cartes de visite: 11 x 7 cm. (this is 4 x 2.5 in.)
    -   if it is NOT a standard size, measure total dimensions rounding up to the next whole cm.
    -   for born-digital images: h x w px. (pixels)

-   Is the image in something (like a frame or folder), or affixed to something (like a page or mat)?  If yes:

    -   add a comma after initial dimensions and add additional details, such as:
    
        -   on sheet h x w cm.
        -   in frame h x w cm.
        -   in folder h x w cm., folded to h x w cm.
        -   on mat h x w cm.
        -   in case h x w cm., folded to h x w cm.

.. admonition:: Question

   **Do you have additional information about the item that doesn't fit elsewhere and would he helpful for public users?**  For example:
   
   -    contextual information about the image content (such as biographical information about a person,
        previous ownership of a house or history of a store, etc.)
   -    unclear information or variations that cannot be clarified (such as multiple possible photographers without a 
        known creator, multiple possible locations, etc.)

******************
Lesser-Used Fields
******************
The rest of the available fields are either rarely used for photographs, or usually pre-populated during upload and 
rarely *changed.*  Use the links to get additional information and resources when needed.  Here is a brief explanation 
of how the fields are used (and why you likely won't edit them), along with a series of questions to help you determine 
if an exception might apply for a specific item:

-   :doc:`primary source </fields/primary-source>` - photographs are generally considered primary sources (and this is usually pre-marked)
-   :doc:`source </fields/source>` - source generally reflects a parent item if we separate a part (e.g., a map from a report)
-   :doc:`citation </fields/citation>` - this is used to parse citation components for items published as serials (like journal articles)
-   :doc:`relation </fields/relation>` - relationships connect two or more items in the Digital Collections when they are related in specific ways
-   :doc:`collection </fields/collection>` and :doc:`institution </fields/institution>` - these fields are pre-set and should not be changed because
    they are used to provide editing access; you may lose permissions if you change these values
-   :doc:`rights </fields/rights>` - there is a general rights statement applied systemwide, so most rights information is only added
    when there is something explicitly noted for the item
-   :doc:`resource type </fields/resource-type>` - generally pre-set to "photograph"
-   :doc:`format </fields/format>` - generally pre-set to "image" (format matches resource type)
-   :doc:`identifier </fields/identifier>` - most photographs will be uploaded with the locally-assigned identifier already entered in the identifier 
    field (i.e., the identifier that the partner organization or owner uses to match the digital copy to the physical copy); photographs rarely have 
    additional identifiers
-   :doc:`degree </fields/degree>` - the degree field is only used for items created at UNT to document the originating college/department
