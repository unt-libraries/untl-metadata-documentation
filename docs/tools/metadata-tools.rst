Quality Control in Metadata
===========================

Introduction
************

Metadata in the UNT Libraries' Digital Collections is always being updated, corrected, and enhanced as needed or when new information ecomes available.  To aid in identifying areas where records may need review or adjustments (e.g., typos, missing information, etc.), a number of tools and features have been built into the interface.

Editing tools are accessible to anyone with an account to edit in the Digital Collections.



***************
About the Tools
***************


-	Data values are compared across the system, but can be limited to specific critera 
	(e.g., a resource type or collection) using the filters on the left side of the screen
-	All tools provide information based on a field or field-qualifier combination, e.g.:

	-	A field only (any qualifiers, or non-qualified)
	-	Field values with missing qualifiers (i.e., "No Qualifier Selected")
	-	A field with a specific qualifier 
		(e.g., creators labeled "author" or subjects labeled "UNTL-BS")
	-	Note that creator and contributor have two options: the role 		
		(main qualifier) and the type, listed at the bottom of the list as per-type (personal 
		name) and org-type (organizational name)
		
-	As a general rule, the tools cannot tell editors when something is "wrong," but they 
	reorganize information to help editors see outliers or values that do not match what is 
	expected for the selected criteria
