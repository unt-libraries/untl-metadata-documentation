==============
Edit Dashboard
==============

The default Dashboard interface (also labeled "Search" in the tools) has a number of features to identify specific sub-sets of records.  In particular, there are a number of filters on the left side of the screen.

*************
General Notes
*************

-	Records that display are based on an individual editor's permissions 
-	Filters only show up when there are at least two options (e.g., "collection" won't display if an editor only has access to edit one collection)

*********
Tool Uses
*********

-	Some filters are useful for quality control, e.g.:

	-	hidden records (in a collection that should be visible)
	-	incomplete records
	-	invalid dates
	-	records without place names / place boxes / place points (that should have them) or vice versa


****************
Tool Limitations
****************

-	Filters show records fitting the criteria but do not provide information about what is wrong without looking at individual records
