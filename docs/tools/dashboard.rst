==============
Edit Dashboard
==============

The default Dashboard interface (also labeled "Search" in the tools) has a number of features to identify specific sub-sets of records.  In particular, there are a number of filters on the left side of the screen.

*************
General Notes
*************

-	Records that display are based on an individual editor's permissions 
-	Filters only show up when there are at least two options (e.g., "collection" won't display if an editor only has access to edit one collection)

*********
Tool Uses
*********

-	Some filters are useful for quality control, e.g.:

	-	hidden records (in a collection that should be visible)
	-	incomplete records
	-	invalid dates
	-	records without place names / place boxes / place points (that should have them) or vice versa
	
-	Sorting can also be relevant, especially sorting by creation date, e.g.:

	-	sort serials to see if the dates in main titles match the order
	-	for publications that have a name change (e.g., NTSU vs. UNT), verify whether items at the beginning/end of the list fall in the range


Quality Control Example
=======================
Here are some examples of what to check specifically from the Dashboard:

-	Are all records visible (or the number expected)?
-	Visible records are complete
-	The numbers for collection/institution seem correct
-	Collection usage is correct (especially if some/all items should be in multiple collections)
-	Dates for visible records are valid
-	Resource types match expectations




****************
Tool Limitations
****************

-	Filters show records that have invalid/misisng values but do not provide information about what is wrong without looking at individual records
